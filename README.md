# camp_finder (Under Development)

This is a camping app that is currently under development and is being created to help campers save time and improve their camping experience. It will provide reliable information and will be available in an easy-to-use app.

### Features (Planned)

- Camping search: With this feature, users will be able to easily find a camping spot near them. The app will provide complete information about each camping spot, including location, available amenities, and user ratings.

- Equipment list: The app will have a complete list of equipment users need to bring for their camping trip. They will be able to easily check off the items they already have and the app will remind them to bring the ones they don't have.

- Camping tips: The app will provide helpful tips to make camping experience more enjoyable and safe. Users will be able to learn about setting up their tent, starting a fire, and protecting themselves from mosquitoes.
